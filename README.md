# React Redux Budgetx App

This is a simple website to Calculate user's budget during specific period of time. Here, a user can add his/her purchases during i.e. a month and calculate his/her rate of money spend. Each Item that the user can add to the application will be categorized from high->low priority. Also, a search bar was added in order to allow the user to search for item that added to the list before. This project was created with React Redux; as a learning project to get use of this feature to be embedded in more complex projects afterwards 'if needed'. 

>Note that this App using Redux-Persist; that means the app will remember your adding/deleted item even if you refresh the page or close it suddenly, so you will not be afraid of loosing data you have entered before.
